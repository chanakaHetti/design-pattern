# SOLID principle

If you're learning TypeScript/ Javascript, you've probably heard about the `SOLID` principles. These five principles help you write better, cleaner, and more manageable code.
`SOLID` principles are,

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Let's break them down into simple terms.

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle - SRP

`Every class should have one job or responsibility.`

When a class does only one thing, itâ€™s easier to understand and maintain. If something changes in the program, you know exactly which class to look at. Otherwise class should have only one reason to change.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle - OCP

`Classes should be opened to extension but closed to modification`

You should be able to add new features to your classes withput changing the existing code. This avoids bug and keeps the system stable.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle - LSP

`Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the program's behavior.`

This ensure that your subclasses work as expected when used in place of their parent classes. It keeps your program predictable and reliable.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle - ISP

`A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn't use.`

By creating specific, small interfaces, you ensure that classes only have the methods they need. This makes your code more flexible and easier to manage.

### Dependency Inversion Principle - DIP

`High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (like interface)`

This principle decouples your code, making it easier to change and maintain. When high-level modules depend on abstracction, you can swap out low-level details without affecting the entire system.
